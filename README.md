# Online Admission

*We completed this project as a team project  as part of the syllabus of my Post Graduate Diploma course at Institute of Information Technology, Jahangirnagar University. But back then some of us were not that familiar with GitHub, so we used to share code on Google Drive. Recently I moved this code to GitHub because I ran out of google driver memory quota.*

#### Brief description about the project
There are two separate projects in this repository that we have developed by two separate teams. One for students and other for official work or admin.Both modules can work independently.  Name of module are below:

 1. Student
